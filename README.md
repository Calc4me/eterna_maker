# EteRNA Structre Generator!

A program designed by [Calc4me](https://eternagame.org/players/460832) to randomly generate valid secondary structures for [EteRNA](https://eternagame.org/) puzzles.

If you have a change that will improve this, you can either fork this and make the change yourself, or message me on EteRNA, and I'll see what I can do. Any suggestions are very much welcome :)

More updates coming soon!

## Current Generations:

- Gen 1
  - First generation, simple and very rigid.
  - Generated very messy seqences because of ) spam.
- Gen 2
  - Second generation, improved on Gen 1.
  - More customizable, but still was messy over 30 nt.
- Gen 3
  - Third generation, improved on Gen 2 w/ new logic.
  - Mainly cleaned up generation and made it more stable in the 20-40 nt range.
- Gen 4
  - Fourth generation, overhauled Gen 3.
  - Improved customization and cleaned up generation to 50-60 nts (with well-tuned paramaters)
- Gen 5
  - Fifth generation, improved on Gen 4.
  - More customization and both cleaned up generation massively, to the point where 200 nts are good.
- Gen 6
  - Clean up Gen 5
  - Make into EteRNA script

#### Note

Was created using [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), which is where .devcontainer and .codesandbox come from.
They don't matter, however, and main.py is the important file.
